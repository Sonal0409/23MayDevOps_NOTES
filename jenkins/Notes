TRIGGERS

TRIGGERS

If we want to automatically trigger a Job

Build triggers for any job:

1. Trigger builds remotely (e.g., from scripts)

Select the above very first option
give Authentication token as : token1 
any unique token number

And then copy the path provided below in this format:
JENKINS_URL/job/job4/build?token=TOKEN_NAME 


update the above url in this way:
Jenkins_URL: Curent url :http://3.140.252.165:8080
Token_NAME: token number/name provided above

Take this path and execute on anyother browser.

http://3.140.252.165:8080//job/job4/build?token=token1

Login as admin admin
you can run that job.

2. GitHub hook trigger for GITScm polling

> Select the above option

Save the job and now go to git hub

Always save the job and then only  go to git hub, perform these steps

go to the repository setting
select webhooks on left side
delete if any exisitng webhook

click on createwebhook on right side

provide following information:

Payload URL : jenkinsurl/github-webhook/ ===> http://3.140.252.165:8080/github-webhook/

Content type : select application/json

Secret: no need of any value

Which events would you like to trigger this webhook?

select first option -- Just the push event.

Select Active
click on add webhook.

now make some changes in repo,
go to jenkins--> you will see a new build has been created

3. Trigger prieodically

Create anew Job--> build trigger--> build preodically --> give */2 * * * * --> Save and build now
All build will be genrated automatically every 2 mins

4. Trigger by POLL SCM

Create a new Job-->Source code management--> Add git path

https://github.com/Sonal0409/GITHUBJENKINSDEMO

Build Triggers--> Poll SCM --> * * * * *

Build will be generated each time there is a chnage in the repository only.

 $ mvn --version

Jenkins--> Manage Jenkins-->Global Tool configuration

Go to JDK section
In this give:
1. Uncheck -- install automatically
2. JDK name as myjava

3 go to terminal/server ==> mvn --version

4. copy the value of variable java Home

JAVA_HOME =

/usr/lib/jvm/java-1.8.0-openjdk-1.8.0.265.b01-1.amzn2.0.1.x86_64

5. Add in jenkins also

Under GIT==> leave it same 

Under maven ==> lets install it automatically
Type mymaven and check the install automatically box.
Save the changes


All set to create pipelines

Upstream downstream pipeline for bUild
************************

1. new Job --complie-->freestyle project
2. Source code management --> select git
--->give git path ===> https://github.com/Sonal0409/DevOpsClassCodes.git

3. build ==> select invoke top level maven targets
   select maven version===> mymaven
    goal ==> compile
4. save ==> build now 
So all the compiled files will be present at this location
==> look for this line in console output at the end on jenkins
Compiling 13 source files to /var/lib/jenkins/workspace/compile1/target/classes


******************************
2nd JOB ==>Code Review
*********************

Jenkins--> new item--> Name= code Review==> freestyle project
==> source codemanagement==>select git==> 
give git repo name https://github.com/Sonal0409/DevOpsClassCodes

Step 2: build ==> invoke top level maven target==>
 select maven version==>mymaven ==> goal = pmd:pmd

save==> build now
==> click on build number and see the console

Goto Workspace on the left side of jenkins Job code review
In the folder go to ==> target folder ==> you will find pmd.xml file.

CONVERT FILE TO TREND REPORT
*******************************
 manage jenkins--> manage plugins--> available --> Search for pmd plugin--> install it.

Now go to the job Code Review==> go to post build actions ==> select Publish PMD anaylsys report

under PMD results==> give path of pmd.xml file ie:  target/pmd.xml

Save the file and build now.

After the build is successfull, you will see PMD Warnings

So you will see 12 new warning have been generated on the code.
Scroll down 
Under package click on first one to check warnings.

*********************************
JOB3: Testing --Unit Test report
********************************

1. jenkins--> new item--> Name= unitTest==> freestyle project
==> source codemanagement==>select git==> give git repo name https://github.com/Sonal0409/DevOpsClassCodes

2. build ==> invoke top level maven target==> select maven version==>mymaven ==> goal = test

3. Save and Build now.

4. Check the workspace

5. surefire-reports will be present

But we cannot understand them easily. So lets generate understandable reports by using Junit reports option under post build actions

6. Go back to job==> post build actions==> select junit test result job
==> give target/surefire-reports/*.xml  ===>under test report xml
This is path where xml files are there.
Here *.xml is as we want to use all the xml files

7. Save and build again

Go to build number ===> on left side you will see Test Result 
Click on it and you can see all pass and fail details of the tests

**************************
JOB4 : Metric check
************************

1. Go to jenkins--> new item--> Name= Metriccheck==> freestyle project
==> source codemanagement==>select git==> give git repo name https://github.com/Sonal0409/DevOpsClassCodes

2.  build ==> invoke top level maven target==> select mymaven
    goal = cobertura:cobertura -Dcobertura.report.format=xml

3.==> save==> build now
==> click on build number and see the console

4. go to Workspace ==> target/site/cobertura/coverage.xml  

The xml file will be there, But we cannot understand them easily. So lets generate understandable reports by downloading cobertura plugin

Go to manage jenkins--> manage plugins--> cobertura --> install it

Go back to the job--> post build actions--> select publish cobertura coverage report
Under cobertura xml pattern give ==> target/site/cobertura/coverage.xml   ==> you can take the path from below displayed text.

Save and build again
Click build number ==> on left side you will find Coverage Report==> click on it ==> we cna see the coverage report.
