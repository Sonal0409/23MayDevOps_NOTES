Note:
******
Ansible module will be completed after Docker & Kubernetes


recap:

Docker hub

Docker Host

systemctl start docker

root level permission to work with docker

Pull an Image and run it into a container

Image Name: 

registryName/reponame/Imagename:tagname


docker pull imagename ==> pull the image from dockerhub, library , image and lastest tag

docker pull imagename:tag  ==>pull the image from dockerhub, library , image and req tag


docker run Imagename ==> pull the image form docker and run it --launch a container


Agenda:
***************

Docker run reference

Docker port mapping

Docker Volumes



Delete Container:

docker rm -f <containername/id>

Delete all container in the docker host

docker rm -f $(docker ps -aq)

*****************

launch a container with a Mode:
****************

1. Foreground Mode : -it

When a container run command is executed with Foreground Mode:

 > Container will be up & running
 > User will be logon to the container

$ docker run --name c1 -it centos

Comout of container

 > ctl pq  ==> container will be running & you will out of the container

 > exit  ==> container will be exited state & you will out of the container


Attach to the container terminal again / go inside the container again

$ docker attach containername/id

Attach to a container when it is Stopped/exited

> you cannot attach or logonto a Exited containter

> you will have start the container again & then attach to it

$ docker start containName/id



2. Detached Mode : -d

When a container run command is executed with Detached Mode:

 > Container will be up & running
 > User will not be attached to the container


 $ docker run --name n1 -d nginx


3. Access the container from browser of your machine:

*** images of type Web server and app servers

 Every image of type web, app, DB servers will have a port exposed to it

using this port any user can access the container application


Port mapping to be done with run command


 -p systemport:containerport

user will give a valid system port and mapp it to container port

 docker run  -p 8989:80 imagname


 - P

 docker will automatically map the container port to system port

 docker run -P imagename

 docker will take free port on host machine and map it to contaienr port




Docker Volumes:

******************


1. Named Volume 

step1: we will create a volume of specific name

docker volume create myvol

> the volume always get created in docker area : /var/lib/docker/volumes

> data will be preserved at : /var/lib/docker/volumes/myvol/_data

Step2: map the volume with the directory of the container whose data has to be preserved

docker run --name c1 -it -v myvol:/tmp centos

Step3: check if data is preserved on the volume or not

Data is being preserved in volume directory

/var/lib/docker/volumes/myvol/_data


2. Bind mounts Volume


Is a type of volume in which any directory of the host machine can be mapped to the container directory


docker run -v /hostdir/path:containerdir imagename


if there a direcotry on hostmachine

/home ==> config.xml

i want this file to be availbe in my container 

some dire : /var/www/html

how cna we do it?


  docker run -v /home/config.xml:/var/www/html imagename




Depoy an ecomm application on a httpd image container


ecomm app code: github

I want to code to be on my docker host:

 git clone 


Copy the current directory files on the container directory


 docker volume : bind mount

 -v /pathdirectory:containerdir


 -v root/ecomm:/usr/local/apache2/htdocs/


Creating a docker file and building an image from it
*******************************************************
it is a simple txt file.

# vim dockerfile
	i

FROM centos    // base image information
MAINTAINER edureka
RUN yum -y update            // these are commands that we give for building the image
RUN yum install git -y		// information about packages that shoudl be 					there on the image
VOLUME /data
:wq!

# docker build -t mycentos:git .

When we run the image -->container will be created.

	# docker images


	# docker run --name c1 -it mycentos1:dockerfile
	

==> data folder which is mounted for volume wll be there

	

OTher instructions that we can give in an Image :
FROM: 

MAINTAINER:

RUN:

CMD:

VOLUME:

EXPOSE:

ADD:

**************************************************

NGINX dockerfile deployment of html file

FROM ubuntu
RUN apt-get update -y
RUN apt-get install nginx -y
COPY index.html /var/www/html/
EXPOSE 80
CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]



Deploy Job in Jenkins:
**************************************
Steps to create a Jenkins job and create docker file and create container for addressbook.war

1. Start the jenkins on AWS instance

# systemctl start jenkins

2. Start docker 
# systemctl start docker

3. Log into jenkins --> go to package job --go to console and copy the path of .war file

4. create a new job -->Deploy

5. Go to build -->shell command

rm -rf mydockerfile
mkdir mydockerfile
cd mydockerfile
cp /var/lib/jenkins/workspace/Package/target/addressbook.war .
touch dockerfile
cat <<EOT>> dockerfile
From tomcat:9
ADD addressbook.war /usr/local/tomcat/webapps
EXPOSE 8080
CMD ["catalina.sh", "run"]
EOT
sudo docker build -t myimage:$BUILD_NUMBER .
sudo docker run -itd -P myimage:$BUILD_NUMBER

Save the job

Go to instance to give jenkins permission to execute docker commands. As of now we are logged in as admin in jenkins and it doesnt have permission to run docker commands.

So go to
vim /etc/sudoers
i
add under root
Jenkins ALL=NOPASSWD: ALL
:wq!

Go back to jenkins and build now.

==> New image and container will be created

# docker images

# docker ps -a

Access from browser

http://18.221.206.57:32768/addressbook/
